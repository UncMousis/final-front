                    Helping students build better habits, one tick at a time.

                    <strong>Routinee</strong> is a simple habit tracker built as part of a full-stack college project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It helps you create, monitor, and maintain your daily goals using a minimalist and effective interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app was built using <strong>React</strong> for the frontend and will be connected to a backend soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built Routinee to help students like ourselves stay on track â€” and learn web development in the process.
